                        In Point Loma, you can find very dangerously beautiful cliffs (photos under "Inspiration"), but in my imagination you can find something much cooler.  For this assignment, I shaded a bezier patch to reflect and refract a sky box to imitate water.  I then shadowmapped my objects to the bezier patch.  I also created different shaders for my objects (the pillars and the cave) to show different mechanics at different times.

                        As you saw from my milestone (Photo is lower center under shadowmapping), I was able to easily get shadow mapping through an online tutorial and as I was applying it to my scene I realized I did not really create it myself.  So I decided to scrap that whole side of my project and create my own from scratch.  I mainly did this to get a better understanding of shadowmapping.  The results are pretty amazing and even lead me to get light shadows.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        To understand this part of my assignment please review over this equation/answer to the question posted -> http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/100439/determine-where-a-vector-will-intersect-a-plane
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        To start this part of the assignment, I first inputted the position of my objects in the scene into my shader manually.  I could use this point and the point of LIGHT0 to get the needed vector, Vd.  I would then use the equation above to calculate when Vd would intersect with my Bezier patch.  This would give me the center point of my shadow.
                        <br />
                        Now that I got one point of the shadow, I used the bounding box of my objects to create a 2D photo of the image.  I would apply this 2D image of the object to my Bezier patch.  This gave me a necessary range of points to darken (put in a shadow).  My shader also mimics a depth field, except instead of using all the points being covered by the object, I only need the center and create the shadow around it.
                        <br /> At first the angle of the shadow was an issue.  However, as you can see above, I was able to adjust that by taking into account the angle between Vd and the light to the patch (VL).  I calculated how steap the angle was and used it to adjust my shadow.  The First image of the long shadow, is from my defaulted light source.  However, when I moved the ligh source up and closer, I was able to get the smaller shadow (as seen in Photo 2 under Shadow Mapping).
                        <br />My shader can currently only do this with the 3 hard coded positions of objects.  If I had more time I would of made it more durable by inputting a list of objects positions and looping through it with the shader.  Then I would immeditaly shade those points.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Now I know what you are thinking, did he really create light shadows? Well yes and no.  These "Fake" light shadows are created because the light is hitting an object that is refracting.  I realized that real objects (The last photo under inspiration) shows that clear objects create lighter shadows then solid ones.  This is mainly due to the fact that the clear material has caustics (Thank you CSE 168).  What I did to immitate this was apply the indexes to the value of my shadow.  The default shadow I have is 0.2 which creates a nice dark shadow.  I then add the ratio of the indexes flipped.  I realized that the more an object would disperse the light, the larger its index should be.  Therefore I could use the index to disperse the light more and more. By the particle effect of light, this would create lighter shadows.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Overall this was an incredible success, not only for the shadows, but also gave me a greater understanding of how the shadows mapping works, instead of relying soley on GL commands.

                        For environment mappping, I mainly focused on two parts: Reflection and Refraction.  I was able to use this to eventually lead to the Phonge Shader
                        <br />
                        For Reflection, I used the vector between my position and my camera as my going in vector.  I then used the Normal of the point to reflect the point and get the color at that sky box.  Refraction was very similar except this time I also used a ratio (which was the indexes of the two materials).
                        <br />
                        In my scene, I used refraction to create a thick ice pillar by using an index close to diamonds.  For the water, I combined both reflection and refraction to create realistic water.  You can clearly see some of the clouds in the sky as the bottom of the sky box is magnified.

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>I combined the main components of light affecting my object to create a phong shader.  However I heard of a form of this where the environment map was also applied to this.  As I will explain next, I broke up my environment map into colors of r,g,b for Chromatic Aberration.  I realized I could then easily combine Phong shading with this to create Phong with some type of irradiance.  As you can see in the photos, the cave is now taking into account the sky box and even reflecting back part of it.</p>

                    <p>This mainly includes basic shaders that I used during previous assignments.  They were very useful in the beginning of the assignment to see if my shaders were having actual change to my objects</p>

                    <p> Chromatic Aberration is mainly those small rainbows you soemtimes see in glass spheres or photos.  As a photographer, I find them as a beautiful effect of light.  Many softwares including VSCO and Lightroom add these effects to photos and adjust it to change the photo.  I decided to separate my environment map shader into the rgb components.  This allowed my to play around with the values and edit the shader to make it seem more real.<br />As you can see in the first two sets of photos above, these changes can be either drastic or minor.  I used the changes to make the shader look more real.  As the last set of photos show, the second one looks a bit deeper.  One can also use this effect to get a more realistic glare off the photo.  </p>

                    <p>This was mainly accomplished through hand calculations of a sine wave.  Since Bezier patches have control points, I simply had the control points change their heights based on different points of different sine waves.  This idea was mainly taked from an old CSE 167 assignment, but this time I added some actual water mechanics characteristics.</p>

                    <p>If you notice a lot of unused code in my turnin, that is mainly because I wanted to add rain and add some texture to it using particle effects, but ran out of time.  Also you may see some more functions in main.cpp, but those are mostly unused.  It was the original shadow map I used before and studied to create my current one.  <br/>Overall, I just wish I had more time for this assignment.  The time given was more then fair, but this final is so much more fun then my other finals.  I am very proud of my work here.  Main issues I felt was having to adjust to not havig a partner, but that just made me more determined in the end to understand everything.  Thank you for an awesome quarter, and have a great break.</p>
