                    <p>For this assigment we created a Mesh viewer of OFF files.  We then were able to observe and implement the different ways to decimate and split edges.  This will prove to be incredibly useful when it comes to puting different models in different scenes because, as we will see, less triangles will cause our programs to speed up.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>For this part of the assignment we were asked to parse through the given OFF format models and draw that model.  We were able to accomplish this by simply storing all the data to vectors of our new Vertex, Edge, and Face classes.  We were then able to easily read all the necessary data in order to draw everything.  We simply read through all the faces and then drew the listed vertices.  We decided to add toggle features for our smooth shading and a model made of lines instead of triangles.  For the line model, we just drew the three edges of each face.  For the smooth shading, we simply went through each vertex's list of faces (which we implemented in Section 3.2 below) and calculated the normal by getting the average of all normals at that point.  We created basic instructions to view the models.  These instructions include scale, zoom, rotate, and translate.  An instruction key for these features, toggling the shaders, and loading the files will be provided at the very end of this write up.

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>For this part of the assignment, we had to really think of how we wanted to implement future parts of this assignment.  We felt the easiest way was to have each Vertx contain a list of the faces it was a part of.  This made it easier to get the smooth shading implemented.  It was also better to calculate the edge cost and pick which edge we were to collapse.  For the questions provided in the assignment2.pdf (What vertices neighbor my current vertex and what faces neighbor my current vertex) we were able to answer and keep track of these very easily with this Mesh Data Structure.  To view it, look inside our MeshDataStructure.h to view the other classes we have added.  </p>

                    <h4>Section 3.3-Mesh Decimation</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>For this part of the assignment, we mainly focused on how we wanted to get rid of faces that shared both vertices without having to add more faces to our arrays.  We thought the best way would be to treat v1 as our new vertice and connect all the edges to this vertice.  We then set the position of v1 to the midpoint of v1.  For the triangles that had both v1 and v2, we would invalidate them.  Invalidate is a feature for our faces that make us skip them when it is time for drawing.  After we made sure this worked similary to the object shown in the paper, we replaced the midpoint with the optimal point v_prime.  Photos of this happening can be found above.  </p>

                    <h4>Section 3.4-Quadric Simplification</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>For this part of the assignment, we simply started with our code from Section 3.3 and implemented the algorithm in Garland's paper.  We calculated each Q matrix for all the vertices present.  We then stored them in each vertex. In order to determine which edge to collapse, we would first calculate all the error matrices for each individual vertex.  We then looped through all the edges in order to find the optimal point and associated error.  We then put each edge into a C++ STL set. This implements a binary tree.  We can then determine which one has the lowest cost and decimate it.  We collpased the edge by simply invalidated the shared faces and setting both v1 and v2 to our new v_prime.</p>

                    <h4>Section 3.5-Progressive Meshes</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>For this part of the assignment, we added features in our Quadric Simplification that would keep track of the changes we created.  We would save each V_prime, V1, V2, and the faces changed of each edge decimation.  The list of faces would only be the ones affected by the change, which were the ones previously owned by V2.  The output would be saved into collapsed_edges.txt.  <br/>Format shown below: <br/><i>VPrime = VPrime_Index: VPrime.x, VPrime.y, Vprime.z <br/>V1 = V1_Index : V1.x, V1.y, V1.z <br/>V2 = V2_Index : V2.x, V2.y, V2.z <br/>Number of affected faces<br/>face = face_index: Vertex affected <br/>...<br/>  </i>
                        The Vertex affected would mainly say which vertex of the three was changed so we can easily change it back.  The index is the place in our vertex vector that the vertex was located.  After we got had all the necessary information it was easy to start the vertex split. <br/> We began by storing all the written information.  We would then undo the changes done in our Quadric split by setting v_prime back to v1, validated v2's faces and setting all the affected faces of v2's list from vprime to v2.
                        <br/>
                        We implemented Geomorph by passing the amount of time passed from frames.  We use that to linear interpolation between the edge and the optimal collapsed point.  We use the delta time to do 10 collpases per second.  Video shown below.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-4">
                    <p>For this assignment we have several features that we feel deem extra credit <br/> To start we used the optimal point inseat of using the midpoint.  After finishing the main parts of Section 3.4, we felt that it would look more relaistic if we used the optimal vertex that was mentioned in the paper <br/> We implemented both smooth shading and a basic toon shader.  Toon Shading was something neither of us have attempted before so we thought it would look amazing on a cow.  <br/> The Line diagram mentioned before not only shows all the edges, but also shows the decimated edges.  By turning on the line mesh by pressing 'l', and then pressing 'c', you can see which edge is getting decimated.  This means that now we can see the edges being decimated and be able to debug much easier.  We though different colored triangles would be interesting, but then realized this was much better for viewing.  Photos and videos of all of these are provided. </p>
